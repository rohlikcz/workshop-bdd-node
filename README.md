# Rohlik BDD workshop
You will find here a simple `Cart` + `Discount` models which we will use to explore and implement BDD with [cucumber](https://cucumber.io/).

We are going to iterate the solution through several steps. For each step we have created a branch called `stepX` where `X` represents the number of the step. If at any point you feel lost or want to check our proposed solution, consult the code there.

# Setup

   - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) + [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
